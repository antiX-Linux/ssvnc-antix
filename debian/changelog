ssvnc (1.0.29-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Add call to dh_strip_nondeterminism.
  * openssl1.1.patch (new): Support OpenSSL 1.1 API changes (Closes:
    #828559).
  * auto-scale.patch (new): Make autoscaling work (Closes: #801804, LP:
    #1312966). In addition to the command-line option "-scale auto"
    creating a 1Ã—1 window, rescaling when resizing the window didn't
    happen, at least not when Caps Lock or other modifiers were active.
  * samemachine_ipv6_overflow.patch (new): Fix stack overflow when
    connecting over IPv6, caused by non-IPv6-aware code (Closes: #774622).
  * nostrip.patch: Don't strip vncstorepw or ultravnc_dsm_helper either.
  * buildflags.patch: Also pass flags to vncstorepw/Makefile and patch
    that to use them.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.8.

ssvnc (1.0.29-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Also get CPPFLAGS from dpkg-buildflags. Pass it as EXTRA_DEFINES to
    vnc_unixsrc/*/Makefile.

ssvnc (1.0.29-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Install ReleaseNotes as upstream changelog file.
  * Simply build-depend on libjpeg-dev instead of libjpeg62-dev |
    libjpeg-dev (Closes: #644808).
  * Install a symlink in /usr/bin instead of including the main vncviewer
    binary twice in the package.
  * Add build-arch and build-indep targets to debian/rules.
  * nostrip.patch: Remove strip command from the Makefile, allowing
    DEB_BUILD_OPTONS=nostrip to work.
  * Get CFLAGS and LDFLAGS from dpkg-buildflags.
  * buildflags.patch: Pass CFLAGS and LDFLAGS through via ./Makefile as
    CDEBUGFLAGS and LOCAL_LDFLAGS to vnc_unixsrc/*/Makefile. This results
    in -fno-strict-aliasing (added by xmkmf by default) being dropped, but
    that doesn't seem to cause any problems.
  * format-security.patch: Fix some flaws uncovered by -Wformat-security.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.2.

ssvnc (1.0.28-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #592873, "Connection from UVNC
    Single-Click does not start vncviewer when -acceptpopups is set").
  * Convert to source format 3.0 (quilt), changing /bin/sh into /bin/bash
    (see below) in the install target instead.
  * debian/copyright: Update years of copyright; remove notice that the
    UltraVNC DSM helper module is not included (which it is since
    1.0.24-1).
  * Remove redundant bash dependency; bash isn't going to be non-essential
    any time soon.
  * Up Standards-Version to 3.9.1.

ssvnc (1.0.27-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * bashisms.dpatch: Don't try to fix all bashisms; instead change /bin/sh
    to /bin/bash and depend on bash, which is small in this context.

 -- Magnus Holmgren <holmgren@debian.org>  Sun, 23 May 2010 19:07:52 +0200

ssvnc (1.0.25-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * confusing_-h.dpatch and bashisms.dpatch: adjusted.

 -- Magnus Holmgren <holmgren@debian.org>  Sat, 06 Feb 2010 20:45:04 +0100

ssvnc (1.0.24-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    * ssvnc -help now prints a help message instead of passing -help to the
      tcl interpreter.
  * confusing_-h.dpatch (new): Improve upstream's handling of -help a bit
    (Closes: 544250).
  * ultraftp_path.dpach (new): Use hardcoded (and correct for this
    package) path to ultraftp.jar if SSVNC_ULTRA_FTP_JAR is unset, so that
    file transfers work even if ssvncviewer is executed directly.
  * bashisms.dpatch (new): Fix most bashisms (all that matter).
  * Drop no_openssl.dpatch and build ultravnc_dsm_helper; OpenSSL
    exception has been granted. Build-depend on libssl-dev.
  * Promote stunnel4 from Recommends to Depends (Closes: #553411), depend
    directly on openssl, depend on tk instead of tk8.4, and tweak java
    recommendations.
  * Add README.source.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3.
